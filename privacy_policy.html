<p>ParkTAG (the &#8220;Service&#8221;) is designed to help you find a parking spot and your vehicle&#8217;s parking position (car, bicycle, etc.). To do so ParkTAG employs industry standard sensor technology (e.g. GPS, cell tower connections, accelerometer, gyroscope, WiFi, barometer, Bluetooth, proximity sensor) to determine your parking position so that the information is recorded on your device for later retrieval. ParkTAG is operated by ParkTAG GmbH, Kantstr. 81 10627 Berlin, Germany which is the controller of your personal data.</p>
<p>We take your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy is intended to inform you about the personal data that is collected from you when you use the Service, how this personal data may be used and disclosed; how you can control the use and disclosure of your personal data; and how your personal data is protected. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact our privacy team at <a href="mailto:privacy@parktag.mobi">privacy@parktag.mobi</a>.</p>

<li><strong>Personal data collected by our Service</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you use the Service, certain Service functions or directly contact us, we <em>may</em> collect your personal data from you, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>personal login (your ParkTAG or social connector credentials);</li>
<li>device information (actual device type, unique IDs (IDFA, GAID, UDID, operating system; battery consumption statistics);</li>
<li>your location (latitude &amp; longitude of parking position, real-time position on handshake (incl. speed, direction and elevation));</li>
<li>phone sensor data (acceleration, rotating motion, air pressure, proximity and compass data);</li>
<li>current device connections (Bluetooth, WiFi, charger)</li>
<li>Service specifics (application ID, version number, anonymous click statistics, parking occupancy for community sharing);</li>
<li>your ParkTAG community profile (nickname, car make and model, profile picture, license plate information, user credits for activity within the community)</li>
<li>contact information, such as name, email address, postal address, phone number, and mobile number;</li>
<li>your browser type and operating system;</li>
<li>for battery consumption optimization we collect the following statistics in intervals; current battery charge, measure interval length, last recharge point, ParkTAG processes running during interval, battery capacity, battery technology and battery health as reported by the operating system;</li>
<li>the web pages you were visiting immediately before and after you came to the Service;</li>
<li>web pages and advertisements that you view, and links that you click on, within the Service;</li>
<li>standard server log personal data; and</li>
<li>correspondence you send to us;</li>
<li>personal data collected through HTML cookies, Flash cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>This data will be collected, processed and/or used for the purposes stated in this privacy policy.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Personal data we collect from other sources</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may access personal data about you from third-party sources and platforms (such as social networking services, databases, online marketing firms, and ad targeting firms), including:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you access third-party social networking services (such as Facebook Connect or Twitter) through the Service, your username and connection lists for those services, statistics of comments, your comments, data from your social networking profile such as your friend list;</li>
<li>demographic data, such as age range, gender, and interests;</li>
<li>advertisement interaction and viewing data, such as ad click-through rates and personal data about how many times you viewed a particular ad;</li>
<li>to improve the service we installed a Training Module in the App. This Training Module will temporarily use data from certain sensors of the smartphone (including WiFi, Bluetooth, barometer, GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, activity recognition, cell tower identifier) as well as information (on/off) on the screen, phone call, headphone, docking and power (battery charger) modus of the smartphone to improve accuracy.<br />
Use of the Training Module is subject to a dedicated user opt-in.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>How we process and use the personal data that we collect</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Email communications</strong></p>
<p>With your consent, we may use the personal data that we collect to send you e-mail communications, such as editorial updates, personal data about your account or changes to the Service. If you signed up for one of our email newsletters, we also will send you the newsletter that you requested.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile communications</strong></p>
<p>With your consent, we may use your mobile phone number to send you notifications or other services. All standard interaction will happen within the app.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We may display advertisements on the Service, many of which are targeted based on personal data about you. For example, using personal data collected through cookies and web beacons we may use demographic data or personal data about your online activities or interests to display targeted advertising that may be relevant to your preferences. Through this process, advertisers reach users who are most interested in their products, and you see advertising for products or services in which you may be interested. Please see our section on the use of cookies and other technologies below.</p>
<p><strong>Request fulfillment</strong></p>
<p>We may use the personal data that we collect to fulfill your requests for products, services, and personal data. For example, we may use your contact personal data to respond to your customer service requests or to enable you to participate in features on the Service such as &#8220;handshake&#8221; or &#8220;auto-detect&#8221; (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Handshake</strong></p>
<p>You can manually report a vacating parking spot (&#8220;post handshake&#8221;). This will share your parking spot with other users. Your chosen identity (name, avatar, car make/model) will become visible to other users. Other users can now open a real time transaction with you. This real time positioning feature serves a well-timed parking spot handover. Should you not want another user to see your real time position do not post a parking &#8220;handshake&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Auto-detect</strong></p>
<p>The Service can automatically predict and detect that you have just left a parking spot, going to leave it, arrived or look for one. It will report these occurrences to the Service. For this purpose the following personal data about you are collected and processed; personal login, device information, location, service specifics and your community profile (see above for details). In order to detect what kind of transport you are using and thereby detecting if the parking spot will be really left and to improve our results, we collect and process sensor data (as listed in section 1). For instance no parking spot would open up if you leave by bus or tram. No such personal data of you will be visible to any other user. Other users will just see an anonymous marker on the map with a timer when it vacated or will vacate. We may display anonymous information about the size of the parking spot based on your car make/model information. If enabled in settings, the Service will also ask you to confirm that you vacated a public parking spot. On confirmation the above mentioned map marker will change color/icon but no additional personal information are being displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
<p>The Service allows you to proactively share details about your parking position with other users privately. Only on your click will we submit details to a chosen community member. The information we collect and submit include your facebook ID (to connect to the other user), vehicle details, location information, notes you saved for this parking and the exact parking garage slot that you may have saved. This feature is designed to inform other users about the actual parking details of your vehicle. Please consider carefully who you share those information with.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook Connect and other Social Plugins</strong></p>
<p>The Service uses Facebook Connect of the Social Network Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (&#8220;Facebook&#8221;) to identify other users of the Service in your friend list. Parking positions are not being shared on your Facebook profile. Instead the actual parking positions are directly transferred from your app to our server which relays the information directly to your friend&#8217;s app. Facebook Connect is used to retrieve the list of other relevant users. Typical context information are being shared (avatar, name).The plugins are indicated by a Facebook logo or marked as &#8220;Facebook Social Plugin&#8221;. If you use the Service on our website, your browser directly connects with the servers of Facebook. Via the Plugin Facebook will receive information that you used our Services. In case you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook may allocate your use of the Service to your user account. If you interact with the Plugins (for example, press the like-button), information about your interaction will directly be transferred to Facebook and stored by Facebook. You may find details about the use of your personal data by Facebook and your options regarding privacy settings by visiting the Facebook privacy policy. If you do not want that Facebook collects your personal data when you use our Service, you have to log off Facebook before using the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Training Module </strong></p>
<p>The data that has been generated with the Training Module (see 1.) will be used to improve the precision of the algorithm (machine learning) that is used for the vehicle detection, i.e. what vehicle the user is using at a given point of time. While the Training Module is active summary statistics of the sensors (like average or minimum and maximum) are being send to the server backend for analysis. The result of the analysis is send back to the smartphone and can be displayed to you for verification. Furthermore, additional debug information can be sent to the backend if needed to understand the decision making process (e.g. trip cancelation due to distance). This helps the algorithm to learn.</p>
